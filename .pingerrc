#
# ok_delay - when ping successful, wait this time before sending next ping request.
# noreply_delay - when ping failed, wait this time before sending next ping request.
#               - Also when reply exceeds this interval, host is marked as offline.
# long_delay - delay of reply after which is host marked as delayed.
# arp - Indicate that host will be pinged using ARP request instead of ICMP ECHO.
